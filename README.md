# note_data_to_instrument
An application that reads note data from for example a .mid file and plays a musical instrument
It currently only reads .mid files right now, if you can get it to read .mxl(sheet music files), .it, .mod, .s3m, .xm files, please add those features in note_data_to_instrument.py.
It only supports synthesizers right now, (for example a square wave or sine wave generator).
It works on raspberry pi right now but I have no idea if it works on raspberry pi clones like the orange pi or if it works on other computers with GPIO ports.
If you can add arduino support please add that feature to note_data_to_instrument.py.
